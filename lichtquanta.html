	<p>I thought it would be fun to do something with LEDs and Arduino. The 
	concept I had in mind for awhile was some sort of light sculpture that could 
	decorate a room. This idea was floating in limbo until I bought 
	<a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10282179/#">a 
	shelf from IKEA</a> that inspired me to go ahead and make something real. 
	You can see the original sketch I did below. The LEDs would be on top of
	tubes sticking out of the shelf and light up. I also wanted there to be a 
	button that you could press to change between the different animations. 
	The name "Lichtquanta" (German for "quanta of light") 
	comes from Albert Einstein, who used it to describe photons.</p>
