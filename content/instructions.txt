To add a new image:
    (1) add image to "images" directory
    (2) make sure metadata is set for "DateTime" and "UserComment"
        (a) Right now I am using Shotwell (photo management software) to do this
    (3) run 'update.py'

To add a new "squawk" / text post:
    (1) add html file to "squawk" page with same template as the others
        (a) the easiest way to do this is to run "add_squawk.py"
        (b) other way can be to copy an existing squawk html file and manually edit that. format must be the same
    (2) run 'update.py'
