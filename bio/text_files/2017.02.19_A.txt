i can never kick this feeling draggin on my heart
that i'm not doing enough
i'm running away from everything
everything being just what i'm suppose to be doing
this engineering degree
these responsibilities
cash for health
but ambition is leaking out
would friends fix it?
would a pill for the anxiety make it all go away?
is it even anxiety? or apathy? 
Avoidant Personality Disorder?
fuck me if i know
i'm trying to simplify my life
i'm trying to pay attention to what i want and what I can to do
but it seems the more you want for yourself the less others want you
being unable to make friends in college seems
very bad and very normal
human
i hate it
blah blah bah bah spa rah dah
