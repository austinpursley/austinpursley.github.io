</p>
<p>i can never kick this feeling draggin on my heart
</p>
<p>that i'm not doing enough
</p>
<p>i'm running away from everything
</p>
<p>everything being just what i'm suppose to be doing
</p>
<p>this engineering degree
</p>
<p>these responsibilities
</p>
<p>cash for health
</p>
<p>but ambition is leaking out
</p>
<p>would friends fix it?
</p>
<p>would a pill for the anxiety make it all go away?
</p>
<p>is it even anxiety? or apathy? 
</p>
<p>Avoidant Personality Disorder?
</p>
<p>fuck me if i know
</p>
<p>i'm trying to simplify my life
</p>
<p>i'm trying to pay attention to what i want and what I can to do
</p>
<p>but it seems the more you want for yourself the less others want you
</p>
<p>being unable to make friends in college seems
</p>
<p>very bad and very normal
</p>
<p>human
</p>
<p>i hate it
</p>
<p>blah blah bah bah spa rah dah
</p>
