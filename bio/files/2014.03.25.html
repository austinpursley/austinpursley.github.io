<p>...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Life seems like it would be much more pleasurable and simple doing something because I want to do it... I'm not trying to be rich. I'm not going to try and climb some bureaucracy.... [There] is the other, smaller part of me. It screams that I don't know what I want. It screams I should push myself. It screams that I'm running away from facing my fears and choosing comfort instead.
