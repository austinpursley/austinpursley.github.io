<p>"Consider a rotting tree stump in a forest. You and I casually walking past it on a trail would not give it more than a passing glance. But wait a moment. Walk around the stump slowly, look at it closely-as a fellow scientist. Before you, in miniature, is the equivalent of an unexplored planet. What you can learn from the decaying mass depends on your training and the science you have chosen to begin your career. Choose a subject, draw on it from anywhere in physics, chemistry, or biology. With imagination you will conceive original research programs that can be centered on the rotting stump."</p>
<p>-E.O. Wilson, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_to_a_Young_Scientist">"Letters to a Young Scientist"</a></p>
