<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/06/the-management-myth/304883/">"The Managment Myth" by Mathew Stewart (2006)</a>:</p>
<p>"...you can save yourself from reading about 99 percent of all the management literature... [it] is mostly a subgenre of self-help."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p> "The Taylorite rationalist says: Be efficient! The Mayo-ist humanist replies: Hey, these are people we’re talking about! And the debate goes on. Ultimately, it’s just another installment in the ongoing saga of reason and passion, of the individual and the group." </p>
<p>"...human beings have produced an astonishing wealth of creative expression on the topics of reason, passion, and living with other people. In books, poems, plays, music, works of art, and plain old graffiti, they have explored what it means to struggle against adversity, to apply their extraordinary faculty of reason to the world, and to confront the naked truth about what motivates their fellow human animals. These works are every bit as relevant to the dilemmas faced by managers in their quest to make the world a more productive place as any of the management literature."
