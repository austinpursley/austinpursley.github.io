<p>"Once you've overcome this fear of the unknown and thereby surmounted your sleeping-out-in-the-wilderness block, you are free. Free to go out, when the world will let you slip away into the wildest places you dare explore. Free to walk from dawn to dusk and then again from dawn to dusk, with no harsh interruptions, among the quiet and soothing cathedrals of a virgin forest. Or free to struggle for a week, if that's what you want at that particular time, toward a peak that has captured your imagination. Or free, if your needs or fancies of the moment run that way, to follow a wild river to its source, fishing as you go, or not fishing. Free,
once you've grasped the significance of this other reality, to immerse yourself for two months in the timeless silence of a huge desert canyonâ€”and
to learn in the end why the silence is not timeless after all.
</p>
<p>But long before the madness has taught you this kind of sanity you have learned many simple and valuable things.</p>
<p>You start to learn them from the very beginning. First, the comforting constants. The rhythm of boots and walking staff, and their different
inflections on sand and on soil and on rock. The creak of harness as small knapsack or heavy pack settles back into place after a halt. And the satis-
factions of a taut, controlled body. Then there are the small, amplified pleasures. In everyday life, taking off your socks is an unnoticed chore;
peeling them off after a long day's walk is sheer delight. At home a fly is something that makes you wonder how it got into the house; when you're
lying sprawled out on a sandbar beside a remote river you can recognize a fly as  something to be studied and learned from- another filament in the intricate web of the world."</p>
