<p>"But being an intellectual is not the same as being smart. Being an intellectual means more than doing your homework. 

If so few kids come to college understanding this, it is no wonder. They are products of a system that rarely asked them to think about something bigger than the next assignment. The system forgot to teach them, along the way to the prestige admissions and the lucrative jobs, that the most important achievements can’t be measured by a letter or a number or a name. It forgot that the true purpose of education is to make minds, not careers.

Being an intellectual means, first of all, <b>being passionate about ideas</b>—and not just for the duration of a semester, for the sake of pleasing the teacher, or for getting a good grade."</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>"Yet there is a dimension of the intellectual life that lies above the passion for ideas... it has had, at its core, a commitment to social transformation. Being an intellectual means <b>thinking your way toward a vision of the good society and then trying to realize that vision by speaking truth to power</b>... It takes more than just intellect; it takes imagination and courage."<p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>
What happens when busyness and sociability leave no room for solitude? The ability to engage in introspection, I put it to my students that day, is the essential precondition for living an intellectual life, and the essential precondition for introspection is solitude... <b>the life of the mind is lived one mind at a time</b>: one solitary, skeptical, resistant mind at a time. The best place to cultivate it is not within an educational system whose real purpose is to reproduce the class system."
