<p>"...I began a correspondence with a Ph.D. student at Harvard University named William L. Brown... a leading world authority on ants... "Wilson," he wrote his teenage follower, "you've made a good start with your project of identifying all the species of ants found in Alabama. But it's time to get serious about a more basic subject, where you can do original work in biology. If you're going to study ants, get serious."... I liked the way Bill Brown addressed me as a colleague, albeit one in training, like a sergeant instructing a private... In spite of my young age and lack of experience, he expected me to behave as a  professional entomologist. He insisted that I just get out there and get the job done. There was no hint of "get in touch with your feelings" or "think about what you'd most like to do."</p>
