<p>"But, you may ask, isn't the cutting edge a place only for geniuses? No, fortunately. Work accompanied on the frontier defines genius, not just getting there. In fact, both accomplishments along the frontier and the final eureka moment are achieved more by entrepreneurship and hard work than by native intelligence. This is so much the case that in most fields most of the time, extreme brightness may be a detriment. It has occurred to me, after meeting so many successful researchers in so many disciplines, that the ideal scientist is smart only to an intermediate degree: bright enough to see what can  be  done but not so bright as to become bored doing it... many of the IQ-brightest join societies like MENSA and work as auditors and tax consultants. Why should the rule of optimum medium brightness hold? (And I admit this perception of mine is only speculative.) One reason could be that IQ-geniuses have it too easy in their early training. They don't have to sweat the science courses they take in college. They find little reward in the necessarily tedious chores of data gathering and analysis. They choose not to take the hard roads to the frontier, over which the rest of us, the lesser intellectual toilers, must travel."</p>
