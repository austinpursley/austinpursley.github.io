<p>Natural Materials</p>
<ul>
<li> Large variety of materials with unique properties. Built with relatively limited number of components (e.g. polymers and ceramics). </li>
<li> Complex hierarchical structures that encompass multiple length scales (nano, micro, macro, etc.). </li>
<li> "Whole is greater than the sum of its parts" </li>
<li> Local optimums for biological functions and constraints. Evolution tailored architecture for many uses. </li>
<li> Combine stiff and soft components. Layered, columnar, or fibrous motifs. Distinct layers with different motifs. Porous, gradients of density. </li>
<li> Many capable of self-repair. </li>
<li> Difficult to synthesize, unclear if possible to produce at mass-scales for human use. </li>
</ul>
<p>Engineered materials</p>
<ul>
<li> Developed through formulation and synthesis of new compounds. </li>
<li> Structural control at micrometer scale, with nanoscale on the horizon. </li>
<li> Most advances occured through trail-and-error or lucky accidents. </li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge is to mimic natural material's complex architectures. Unlike biological mechanisms, human engineering is not limited by materials, structures, etc. Potentially endless possibilities.</p>
