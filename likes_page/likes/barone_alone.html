<p>[Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone on working alone]

<p>But throughout the four and a half years, he never once reached out online by asking questions or speaking to another developer for advice. He hates asking for help. He prefers not having the subconscious feeling of owing a debt for a favor, so instead he does things all himself. Everything—literally everything—he learned about making games came from poring over pre-existing comment threads on forums and blogs until he found the solutions he needed to move forward.

<p>"If I have an idea, I have complete freedom to incorporate that into the game, exactly the way I want it. I think it can result in a little more cohesion, since you don't have competing visions for the game battling with each other. I also find it more fun to do a variety of things, rather than spend all of my time programming, for example."</p>

<p>"...I think that Stardew wouldn't be the same if I didn't make it alone. I believe there is something special about solo development.... I was able to create a cohesive vision and indulge my own whims to a large degree... in a way that seems impossible in a team. I prefer working this way, and I don't know if I'll ever want to work in a team. I want complete creative control. I just think this is my niche, this is who I am."
