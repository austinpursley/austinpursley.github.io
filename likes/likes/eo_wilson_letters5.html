        <p>“There is another quality in which you might or might not be well endowed but if not should at least try to cultivate. It is entrepreneurship, the willingness to try something daunting you’ve imagined doing and no one else has thought or dared…. entrepreneurship is enhanced by performing lots of quick, easily performed experiments… quick, uncontrolled experiments are very productive… Performing small, informal experiments is an exciting sport, and the risk in lost time is small. However, if a preliminary procedure proves necessarily time-consuming or expensive or both, the cost in time and money can become quickly prohibitive. If the effort fails, entrepreneurship requires the character and the means to start over - just as it does in business and other careers outside of science.”</p>
