        <p>“All he’d ever wanted was for nothing to ever change. Or for things to change only in the right ways, improving little by little, day by day, forever… You ate the same food, woke up at the same time, wore the same clothes. Hitches, bad habits, useless thoughts ― whatever you didn’t need slowly fell away. Whatever was simple and useful remained. You improved little by little till the day it all became perfect and stayed that way. Forever.”</p>

<p>He knew it sounded crazy when you put it like that.”</p>
