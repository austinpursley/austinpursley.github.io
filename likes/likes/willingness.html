        <p>Willingness &gt; Willpower</p>

<p><a href="http://nautil.us/issue/45/power/against-willpower">“Against Willpower” by Carl Erik Fisher (2017)</a>:</p>

<p>“Willpower may simply be a pre-scientific idea—one that was born from social attitudes and philosophical speculation rather than research, and enshrined before rigorous experimental evaluation of it became possible. The term has persisted into modern psychology because it has a strong intuitive hold on our imagination: Seeing willpower as a muscle-like force does seem to match up with some limited examples, such as resisting cravings, and the analogy is reinforced by social expectations stretching back to Victorian moralizing. But these ideas also have a pernicious effect, distracting us from more accurate ways of understanding human psychology and even detracting from our efforts toward meaningful self-control. The best way forward may be to let go of “willpower” altogether. Doing so would rid us of some considerable moral baggage. Notions of willpower are easily stigmatizing: It becomes OK to dismantle social safety nets if poverty is a problem of financial discipline, or if health is one of personal discipline.”</p>

<p>GoodbyColumbus in the comments says: “I rejected the traditional notion of willpower nearly 50 years ago after struggling to read a book I disliked for a college test. What I have come to rely on over the years is to focus on my willingness rather than my willpower. Obviously, the more willing we are to do something the more likely we are to do it. Unlike willpower our willingness depends on internal and external circumstances, many of which can be changed. So, when I feel resistant to doing something I think would be good, I don’t push myself but instead try to figure out how to change circumstances to make me more willing. It doesn’t always work, but willpower never worked for me except momentarily. The more I would push myself, the more a part of that self would push back. Willpower divides the self. Willingness unites the self.”</p>
