        <p>“Does being a leader, I wondered, just mean being accomplished, being successful? Does getting straight As make you a leader? I didn’t think so. Great heart surgeons or great novelists or great shortstops may be terrific at what they do, but that doesn’t mean they’re leaders. Leadership and aptitude, leadership and achievement, leadership and even ex­cellence have to be different things, otherwise the concept of leadership has no meaning. And it seemed to me that that had to be especially true of the kind of excellence I saw in the students around me… great kids who had been trained to be world-class hoop jumpers. Any goal you set them, they could achieve. Any test you gave them, they could pass with flying colors. They were, as one of them put it herself, “excellent sheep.”</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>“That’s really the great mystery about bureaucracies. Why is it so often that the best people are stuck in the middle and the people who are running things—the leaders—are the mediocrities? Because excellence isn’t usually what gets you up the greasy pole. What gets you up is a talent for maneuvering… Just keeping the routine going… you will find yourself in environments where what is rewarded above all is conformity. I tell you so you can decide to be a different kind of leader.”

<p>“What we have now are the greatest technocrats the world has ever seen, people who have been trained to be incredibly good at one specific thing, but who have no interest in anything beyond their area of exper­tise. What we don’t have are leaders.</p>

<p>What we don’t have, in other words, are thinkers. People who can think for themselves. People who can formulate a new direction: for the country, for a corporation or a college, for the Army—a new way of doing things, a new way of looking at things. People, in other words, with vision.”</p>

<p>[Deresiewicz describes how solitude helps with being able to think for yourslef. This means: intimate conversations with yourself (introspection) and friends, concentration, and seeking revolutionary ideas / alternative viewpoints]</p>

<p>“Once the situation is upon you, it’s too late. You have to be prepared in advance. You need to know, already, who you are and what you believe…”</p>

<p>-William Deresiewicz, “<a href="https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/">Solitude and Leadership</a>”</p>
