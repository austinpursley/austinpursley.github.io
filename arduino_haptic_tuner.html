	This TED talk on sensory substitution</a>, a love of music, and my desire to 
	learn about microcontrollers and electronics was what inspired me to start 
	this project. The basic concept: a musical tuner with a twist, one that will 
	allow you to "feel" if the note your are playing/singing is in tune. Music 
	tuners are tools that help musicians make sure their instrument/voice is 
	within an acceptable range of a desired pitch i.e. "in tune". Typical portable tuners use 
	LEDs and digital screens to let people <em>see</em> the result but the TED 
	talk had me thinking it would be neat if you could instead <em>feel</em> it 
	using something like Dr. Eagleman's vest of vibration motors.</p>

	<p>The prototype takes audio in from an electret microphone and amplifies it 
	for the Arduino using an op-amp pre-amplifier. The Arduino calculates a 
	frequency value from the audio signal and compares that to an 
	<a href="http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html">equal-tempered scale</a> 
	to determine if the note is in tune or not. Then the Arduino vibrates one of 
	five motors accordingly.</p>
