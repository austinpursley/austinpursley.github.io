 I thought it would be fun to do something with LEDs and Arduino. The 
 concept I had in mind for awhile was some sort of light sculpture that could 
 decorate a room. Buying a 
 shelf from IKEA inspired me to go ahead and make something.

 Initial crude sketch
 


 Tubes are installed into the shelf in a wave pattern. The LEDs on top of the tubes are encased with glass "bulbs" (little glass jars covered with paper). A ribbon cable behind the shelf wires the lights to the Arduino. Pressing the Arudino's button changes between different lighting states. Its name "Lichtquanta" (German for "quanta of light") 
 comes from Albert Einstein, who used it to describe photons.

 The electronics. Not very elegant, I know, but this being one of my first projects I wanted to keep things very simple
 


 Quick ideas for improvements: specialized LED hardware, encase hardware, RGB LEDs, dimming and flickering effects, glass tubes that light up entirely (instead of just bulb at top), wire bundles/cables, get rid of cheap shelf entirely.
