<p>My summary of <a href="http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~naderi/Claude%20Shannon.html">"Creative Thinking" by Claude Shannon (1952)</a>:</p>
<p>Shannon thinks there are three requirements for someone to be exceptional at producing good ideas in scientific or technical fields:</p>
<p>(1) training and experience</p>
<p>(2) certain level of talent/intelligence</p>
<p>(3) motivation</p>
</body></html>The third often seems to be what makes someone great. Motivation means being curious, having a very high desire to solve problems and figure out how things work, and often being dissatisfied i.e. thinking "This is OK, but I think things could be done better".
<p> Shannon's tricks for creative work / problem solving: </p>
<p> <p style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;"> Simplify the problem.</p> Cut a problem down to only the essentials. For example, "She went to the store and bout 5 biscuits and ate 3 on her way back home, how many does she have left to share?" can be simplified into "5 - 3 = 2".</p>
<p> <p style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">Seek similar problems.</p> 
If you have solved many problems, it is likely you can reach back into this "mental matrix" of problem/solutions and find something similar.</p>
<p><p style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">Restate the problem in as many forms as you can.</p> "Change the words. Change the viewpoint. Look at it from every possible angle". It's important to do this so that your approach doesn't stagnate. This is why sometimes someone brand new to a problem can solve it easily when someone else got stuck in a rut.</p>
<p><p style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">  Generalize solutions.</p> After solving a specific problem, you may be able to expand the scope of the problem/solution to solve a larger class of problems. "He will leave it where it was in two dimensions before he will do it in N dimensions".</p>
<p><p style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;"> Structural analysis of a problem.</p> Instead of one massive, unimaginable jump to a solution, you may have to find a path using a series of smaller problem/solutions. What solution you find may take many small leaps and be clumsy, but once you are there is should be much easier to see how to simplify it.</p>
<p><p style="font-weight: bold; display: inline;">Invert the problem.</p> If given the solution, how would you go about getting to the problem?</p>
