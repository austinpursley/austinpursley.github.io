	<p>I did this project to get some experience with Python and also learn about something interesting, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a>. The concept was pretty simple: let the user choose colors close to their favorite from a randomly generated set. Then the selected colors are used as "parents" to generate a new set of "children" colors. The child set is then suppose to be closer to the users favorite color. This can continue for several "generations" until the user has a set of colors that all match pretty well what color they had in mind.</p>
