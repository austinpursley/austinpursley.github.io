	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INaturalist">iNaturalist</a> is "an online social network of naturalists, citizen scientists, and biologists built on the concept of mapping and sharing observations of biodiversity across the globe". Users upload wildlife observations (usually photos but also audio and GIFs) and other users and AI tools help provide an identification. <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/getting+started">More info on getting started.</a></p>


<p>It's an amazing resource that can make you suddenly see the unfamiliar in the familiar. What really hooked me first was plants. Before, I never really paid attention to plants, it was like most of them just blurred together. But I had always wanted to identify plants on hikes, especially trees, and iNat made it very easy to cure my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_blindness">"plant blindness"</a>. I especially had a blast exploring the rich flora diversity in the nearby Croatan National Forest. How could I not fall in love with plants when I was often walking among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatwoods">longleaf pines</a> and finding carnivorous plants in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocosin">pocosins</a>? I couldn't wait to get out every weekend and discover plants I hadn't seen before. And, you know, there wasn't much better to do during a global pandemic.</p>

    <p>Since starting in 2020, I've identified ~250 types of plants and ~100 species of others organisms. And it's not just IDing plants, I've also picked up a web of botanical knowledge about ecology, evolution, etc. Anyways, I highly recommend anyone with even a little bit of curiosity to start using iNat and learn about the plants and other wildlife that live in their area.</p>
