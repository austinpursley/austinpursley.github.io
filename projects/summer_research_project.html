	<h1>Plant Drought Stress Image Processing Summer Project</h1> 
	<p>
	This work was for a summer course. It was loosely tied to someone else’s research project of using drones equipped with multiple cameras to analyze plants from above in a way that could be helpful for agriculture. My goal was to gather data on some plants and determine how “thirsty” i.e. drought stressed they were.

	<h2> Overview </h2>
	<p>
	I first spent a week capturing images of plants, half of which were not watered to make them drought-stressed. I had a Raspberry Pi hooked up  with a thermal (IR) and color (VL) camera on a breadboard and would go to a greenhouse on campus multple times a day to capture the images. I also used a white background to make the future image processing easier. I stream-lined the process throughout the week by improving the Python image capturing script running on the Pi and getting faster at moving plants around.

	With the images collected, the "region of interest" (ROIs) of the images could be determined. In this case the ROI was simply the plant and the goal was to determine the set of pixels that corresponded to it. I almost completely automated this by applying simple 
	<a href="image_processing_thermal.html">threshold and morphological operations </a>
	(with Python + OpenCV). However, a set of threshold values didn't work for all images so there was a manual element in changing the values in order to get correct ROIs for all the images.

	<p>
	With the ROIs I could find some image features. For VL the image feature I used was the hue color value. IR images was just "plant surface temperature". Using the ROIs I calculated mean and variance of those properties and plotted them overtime. In short, there wasn't any strong correlation between the image features I calculated and the amount of time it had been since the plant had been watered. Therefore the results were inconclusive.

	<h2> Conclusion </h2>
	
	<p>
	For this project I collected images myself and then anlayzed those images to extract relevant features. It was an interesting hands-on look at the first few stages of a full data-analysis project. I think I especially learned a lesson in how much care and thought has to go into creating a high-quality dataset. It was a shame that altough there were plans to go on to applying machine learning, it was discouraged by the inconclusive results.
