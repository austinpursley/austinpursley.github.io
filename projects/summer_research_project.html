	<h1>Plant Drought Stress Image Processing Summer Project</h1> 
	<p>
	Over the summer I did some work with another's research project that involved drones equipped with multiple cameras to analyze plants for agriculture. My goal was to gather data on some plants and determine how “thirsty” i.e. drought stressed they were with image processing.

	<h2> Overview </h2>
	<p>
	My first objective was to caputre image data of some plants, half of which would be drought-stressed. For this task I used a Raspberry Pi hooked up with thermal (IR) and color (VL) cameras. I visited the plants at a greenhouse multple times a day to capture the images. Throughout the week I streamlined the process by improving the Raspberry Pi's Python script for capturing images.

	<p>
	With the plant images collected, the "region of interest" (ROIs) could be determined. In this case the ROI was simply the plant and the challenge was to determine the set of pixels that corresponded to it. I almost completely automated this by applying simple 
	<a href="image_processing_thermal.html">threshold and morphological operations </a>
	(with Python + OpenCV). However, a set of threshold values didn't work for all images so there was a manual element in changing the values in order to get correct ROIs for all the images.

	<p>
	With the ROIs I could find image features. I chose the hue color value for VL images and plant surface temperature for IR images. After plotting those feature's mean and variance over time I determined there wasn't any strong correlation between those values and the amount of time it had been since the plant had been watered. Therefore the results were inconclusive.

	<h2> Conclusion </h2>
	
	<p>
	This was an interesting project where I had to do all the data collection and analysis myself. I think I especially learned a lesson in how much care and thought has to go into creating a high-quality dataset.
