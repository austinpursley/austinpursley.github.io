	<h1>Image Processing Part 3: Skin Extraction</h1> 
	<p>
	The senior design project I have been working on in school is a "smart mirror". 
	Equipped with a thermal and RGB camera, its primary purpose is to analyze a user's face and give health feedback. 
	The subsystem I was responsible for was image processing and
	my goal was to analyze the images to obtain health metrics.
	Here I go over extracting the user's skin.
	</p>

	<h2> Skin </h2>	
	<p>
	If you take a picture of someone and want to do some image analysis of their
	skin lesions, first you have to determine which part of the image is their skin.
	A major requirment for this process was that it had to be more flexible than
	simply providing a fixed range of color values meant to include all human 
	skin types.
	</p>

	The
	<a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2011/Mittal11/mittal11.pdf">idea</a>	
	behind the skin extraction process here is that if you know where 
	the face is then you have an approximation of what the rest of the skin 
	looks like.	This works well because of how easy it is to incorporate face 
	detection and is indifferent to what that face color may actually be.
	The process can also be improved by detecting and removing eyes and mouth 
	before skin color range is calculated.

	<h2> Corner Cases </h2>
	<p>
	This process will still include any background areas or hair that are too similar to the skin
	color of the user. In addition, accuracy of skin detection depends on the 
	accuracy of face and face feature detection. For the length of this project 
	I used OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers for this detection because they 
	were the easiest solution on hand. However they were not all that accurate, 
	especially for mouth and eye detection; if I were to go back I would look at 
	alternatives such as

	facial landmarks with dlib</a>.
