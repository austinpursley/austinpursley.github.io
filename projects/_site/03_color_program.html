	<p>I did the project for more Python experience and to learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a>. The concept is pretty simple: the user chooses colors close to their favorite from a randomly generated set. Then the selected colors are used as 'parents' to generate a new set of 'children' colors. The child set is then suppose to be closer to the user's favorite color. This can continue for several 'generations' until the user has a set of colors that all match pretty well to what the user had in mind.</p>

	The application is built with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">tkinter</a>, a Python GUI toolkit. Details on the evolution and more can be found in the code on
	<a href="https://github.com/austinpursley/favorite-color-spawning">
