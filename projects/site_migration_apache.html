		<h1>Migrating Website From GitHub Pages to Apache Web Server</h1> 
		9.20.2020	
	</div>	
	
	<p>I've had my website hosted through <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for awhile. This was a fine solution as I only needed a static website built with front-end languages i.e. HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Now I am curious about the "full stack" of website development and want to dip my hands into the server and databases side of things. This should give me full control over my website and get me into more advanced applications.</p>

    <p> This is the first part in how I am figuring out how to do that. I didn't really need to write this whole post out because it is a relatively straightforward and routine process that's described in zillions of online guides. But it at least proves I've learned something and will be useful months later when I try to remember what I was doing exactly.</p>

    <p>A popular web service stack is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</a>: Linux (Operating System), Apache (Web Server), MySQL (Database), and PHP/Perl/Python (Server application programming). I can start with the OS for my server, Linux. I didn't want to host the website on my own machine so I paid a cloud service, DigitalOcean, to do it. The OS on my "droplet" server is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu">Ubuntu</a>, a Linux distribution. I chose Ubuntu because I am already familiar with it as the OS on my personal Laptop and it seems to be more friendly for beginners. I then followed <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04">some steps</a> to lay a solid foundation for my server which included <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-1804">setting up SSH Keys for secure communication</a>, creating a new non-root user with sudo privileges, and enabling the firewall.</p>

    <p>That takes care of the "L" in LAMP, now onto the "A". Apache is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web server</a> that will contain my website and process incoming network requests. To install Apache onto my server, all I had to do was log in to my non-root user and run the "sudo apt install apache2" command. Continuing to follow <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-18-04"> a guide</a>, I learned some basics like how to check the status and restart Apache.</p>

    <p>When Apache is first set-up, there is a default landing page. To see this landing page, I can enter the IP address of my Ubuntu server into my web browser. Roughly how this works: by entering in the IP address, my web browser is sending a request to the Ubuntu server to see website content. This request will come in through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">"port"</a> that the Apache web server program will be "listening" to. When my new Apache web server receives the request, it will process it and respond back to the web browser with the landing page.</p>

    <p>But I don't want a default landing page that's accessed through an IP address, I want to display content for my own website when someone visits my "www.austinpursley.com" domain name. To do this, I needed to map the IP address to my domains and reconfigure my Apache server's "virtual host".</p>

    <p>Mapping my domain names, "austinpursley.com" and "www.austinpursley.com", to the server IP address <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/how-to/manage-records/">involved</a> creating an "A" DNS record through DigitalOcean and NameCheap (where I bought my domain name).</p>

    <p>For the next process, I started by creating a new directory within the Apache directory for my website content e.g. HTML files. I then <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-18-04">set-up the virtual host</a> by reconfiguring the Apache virtual host files. These files dictate how Apache will respond to domain requests. I created a new virtual host file whose meaning translated to "if a request for "www.austinpursley.com" or "austinpursley.com" is received on port 80, respond with content from the austinpursley.com directory".</p>

    <p> Finally, I had to get my website content onto the server. Before I was using Git for version control and to deploy my website online to GitHub. Now I wanted to push the website to my own server instead of GitHub. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-automatic-deployment-with-git-with-a-vps">This</a> included installing Git onto my server, setting up a Git repository just for version control, and configuring the Git server hooks that will move files to my website directory when a push is completed.</p>

    <p> And that's it, <a href="../index.html">www.austinpursley.com</a> is live once again.</p>

    <p> Next time I plan to get into the "M" and "P" of LAMP through creating a basic web applicaiton. I also still need to figure out how to enable HTTPS encryption, perhaps I will cover that as well.</p>
