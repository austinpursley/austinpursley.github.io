        <h1>Restoring a ~1980 Schwinn Traveler Bicycle</h1>

<em>Catalog photo of 1980 Schwinn Traveler, from <a href="https://bikehistory.org/bikes/traveler/">bikehistory.org</a>. I’m pretty sure bike this is the bike I restored.</em></p>

<p>Dad’s old bicycle had been rotting away in garages for a few decades and I made a project of restoring it back to its former glory. I had never really had any interest in bicycles before, so it required a lot of synthesizing information from old forums and YouTube tutorials.</p>

<p>The bike itself is a ~1980 Schwinn Traveler. It is nothing fancy, just a budget road bike as far as I can tell. It has a 1020 carbon steel frame that is 30+ pounds, pretty dang heavy.</p>

<p>But I didn’t need anything amazing. I was just looking for (1) something to keep me occupied during the summer break, and (2) a possible alternative transportation mode for when I went back to college in the fall. Plus, I liked the look of the bike quite a bit. The red and chrome is cool and feels “vintage”.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t do much documentation during the project. I’ll just include the few notes and photos I have here.</p>

<p>Some of what I did:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Replaced tubes and tires</li>
  <li>Replaced the wheel ball bearings and grease</li>
  <li>Replaced the handle bar tapes</li>
  <li>Replaced one of the wheel axles</li>
  <li>Lubricated the freewheel</li>
  <li>Took the bike apart and cleaned nearly every piece to remove dirt, rust, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Photos throughout the process.</p>
