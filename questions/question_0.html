    are the chemical elements all plants need to survive and reproduce. Those required in large amounts are the macronutrients and those required in small amounts are the micronutrients. There is a further distinction for "beneficial" elements that help plants grow or are essential for only a subset of plants.

    Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen are aborbed by the plant through the atomosphere or water. Apperently Oxygen can also come from Sluphate, Nitrate, and Phosphate found in soil, but I can't confirm this because Wikipedia doesn't provide a source [1].
