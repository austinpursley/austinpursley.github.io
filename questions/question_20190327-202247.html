                <p><a href="references/plant_nutrients.png">Nutrients</a> are the chemical elements all plants need to survive and reproduce. Those required in large amounts are the macronutrients, those in small amounts are the micronutrients. There is a further distinction for "beneficial" elements that help plants grow or are essential for a subset of plants.</p>

                <p>Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen are aborbed plant through the atomosphere and water. Apperently Oxygen can also come from Sluphate, Nitrate, and Phosphate, but I can't confirm this because Wikipedia doesn't provide a source.</p>
