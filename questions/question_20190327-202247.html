                <p>From the perspective of chemical elements, the inputs and outputs of plants would be known as nutrients. According to <a href="https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_General_Biology_(Boundless)/31%3A_Soil_and_Plant_Nutrition/31.1%3A_Nutritional_Requirements_of_Plants/31.1C%3A_Essential_Nutrients_for_Plants">General Biology on LibreTexts</a>, elements are nutrients if "a plant cannot complete its life cycle without it, if no other element can perform the same function, and if it is directly involved in nutrition" (nutrition perhaps meaning life-sustaining chemical reactions i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism">metabolism<a>). Those required in large amounts are the macronutrients, the small are the micronutrients.</p>

                <p>However, these are just the singular elements. In what form do they come into the plants?</p>
